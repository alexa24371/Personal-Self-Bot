# Discord Self Bot

## Introduction

A **self-bot** is a Discord automation tool that operates using a **real user account** rather than the official Discord Bot API. This enables actions that normal bots cannot perform due to API limitations.

Examples of such actions include:
- Automating slash commands from other bots  
- Creating **native Discord polls** (built-in polls, not embeds)  
- Bypassing bot-only authorization restrictions  

This project contains **hardcoded IDs and custom functions** designed specifically for my personal use. While it may serve as a starting point for other self-bot projects, it is **not beginner-friendly** and assumes prior knowledge of Discord automation and internals.

## Disclaimer
