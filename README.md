# Discrd Self Bot

## Introduction 
A self bot is a discord bot that uses a actual uesr account for automations, instead of using the offical discord api.
It may be used to do tasks that an ordinary discord bot may not be able to do due to api limitations.

Examples of these task may be:
> Automate slash command of other bots
> Creating Actual Poles (the built-in ones)
> Bypassing Bot Authorisation 

This is for Personal Use Only

The use of `self-bot` may violates discord's terms and conditions, use code at your own risk
